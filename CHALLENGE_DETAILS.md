### Challenge Summary

Data from several different space-based exoplanet surveying missions have enabled the discovery of thousands of new planets outside our solar system, but most of these exoplanets were identified manually. With advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML), it is possible to automatically analyze large sets of data collected by these missions to identify exoplanets.

**Your challenge is to create an AI/ML model that is trained on one or more of the open-source exoplanet datasets offered by NASA and that can analyze new data to accurately identify exoplanets.**

### Background

Exoplanetary identification is a rapidly growing area of astronomical exploration. Scientists use the "transit method" to detect a dip in a star's light as a planet passes in front of it. Several key missions have provided the data for these discoveries:

*   **Kepler:** A well-known satellite that provided transit data for nearly a decade.
*   **K2:** The successor mission to Kepler, which used the same hardware to survey different areas of space.
*   **TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite):** Launched in 2018, TESS continues the mission of surveying the sky for transiting exoplanets.

Publicly available datasets from these missions include information on confirmed exoplanets, planetary candidates, and false positives, with variables like orbital period, transit duration, and planetary radius. Despite advances in technology, much of this data is still analyzed manually. This challenge provides an opportunity to leverage AI/ML to uncover new exoplanets hidden within this data.

### Your Objectives

Your goal is to create an artificial intelligence/machine learning model that not only analyzes data to identify new exoplanets but also includes a **web interface** for user interaction.

-   **Train Your Model:** Utilize one or more of NASAâ€™s open-source exoplanet datasets from the Kepler, K2, or TESS missions.
-   **Analyze Data:** Your model should classify data points as confirmed exoplanets, planetary candidates, or false positives.
-   **Consider Key Variables:** Think about how variables like orbital period, transit duration, and planetary radius might influence the classification. How you process and use this data can significantly impact your model's accuracy.
-   **Design for Users:** Think about who will use your tool. Will it be for researchers or for novices? Can users upload their own data? Will your model learn from user-provided data?

### Potential Considerations

You are encouraged, but not required, to consider the following:

*   **Target Audience:** Your project could be aimed at researchers wanting to classify new data or at beginners who want to interact with exoplanet data for the first time.
*   **Dynamic Learning:** Your interface could allow the tool to ingest new data and continuously train the model.
*   **Performance Metrics:** The interface could display statistics about the accuracy of the current model.
*   **User Control:** Your model could allow users to tweak hyperparameters directly from the interface.
